              JEI's information tab is actually the best thing added by any mod ever, and should be used by everything. Unfortunately, very few mods take advantage of it.
              
              That's where this mod comes in. I went through a ton of mods and added information tabs to just about everything that needed them.
              
              "Now Aaron," I hear you ask, "what if I don't want to have another tab in JEI for every single item?"
              
              Each mod has its own config option you can disable, so if you don't want this or that to have a paragraph or two describing what they are, you can turn them off.

              The list of mods that are currently supported are:
              * Quark
              * Quark again, but the vanilla tweaks are separate (and they're only there if they're enabled in Quark's config, which took way longer than it would have taken a competent mod-maker)
              * Twilight Forest
              * Tinkers Construct (but half of it doesn't work because you can't add information tabs to items that have NBT and I didn't know that before I'd done them all)
              * Refined Storage
              * Refined Storage Addons
              * Nature's Compass
              * Waystone
              
              
              "But Aaron, isn't this basically a glorified CraftTweaker script?"
              
              To that, I say
