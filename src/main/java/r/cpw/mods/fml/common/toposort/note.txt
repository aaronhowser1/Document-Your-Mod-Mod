This file has been taken and mostly copy-pasted from the source code of Forge Mod Loader (FML for short), made by
cpw. Why not using it directly? Because his Topological Sort is deeply interconnected with the internals of the loading
process. For this reason, I am copying it and making it sort of generic, hopefully. No infringement intended.

Due to the extensiveness of the changes, comments cannot be used. Users who want to check the differences are
more than welcome to compare the original version of the code available in the Forge's repository with ours.
