This is a list of all skipped features that couldn't be documented because... they literally do not affect places
that DYMM can document.

Client:
- Auto Jump Hotkey (no items)
- Better Fire Effect (fire is not obtainable; flint and steel is a no)
- Items Flash Before Expiring (I am not going to add an entry for every single item)
- No Potion Shift (no items; and no, potions do not matter in this tweak)
- Panorama Maker (no)
- Render Items In Chat (again, as Items Flash...)
- Show Invalid Slots (no items)
- Usage Ticker (no)
- Visual Stat Display (yes, I could show it only for armor and weapons, but it affects basically everything that changes attributes, so no)

Experimental:
- Better Nausea (there's no Nausea potion)
- Bigger Caves (no items)
- Custom Splashes (it edits the main menu)
- Dump Texture Atlas (no visible effects)
- Print Suppressor (something only visible in logs)
- Reactive Cursor (too bad, I love it; but anyway no items)
- Reject Mods (no items)

Management:
- Auto Tool Restock (I won't add a tooltip to all usable items)
- Change Hotbar Keybind (no items)
- Favorite Items (I won't add a tooltip to every single item)
- Inventory Sorting (no items)
- Delete Items (no items; and no, not all items either)
- F To Switch Items (same as Favorite Items)
- Link Items to Chat (same as Favorite Items)

Miscellaneous:
- Lock Direction Hotkey (too many potential candidates)
- Snow Golem Player Heads (no spawn egg)
- Reacharound Placing (not every block, no)

Tweaks:
- Automatic Recipe Unlock (no)
- Improved Sleeping (makes no sense on a bed, because a bed can't be AFK)
- Slabs To Blocks Recipe (too many)

Vanity:
- Dye Item Names (not gonna add a doc to any item)
- Emote System (no items)

World:
- Default World Options (no items)
- Pirate Ships (I've done almost all world generation, but there are sincerely too many blocks for this and so it's clutter)
- Realistic World Type (how?)
- Varied Dungeons (no items)
